Aggregate Question: How does resource management work in a multi-user OS?
Answer:  In a multi-user OS, resource management allocates CPU, memory, and I/O devices among users and their processes based on scheduling and priority policies. The OS monitors usage to ensure fairness, prevent conflicts, and enforce limits. It reclaims and redistributes resources as needed to maintain system efficiency and responsiveness.

Aggregate Question: What ensures one program can't interfere with another in memory?
Answer: Memory protection ensures one program can't interfere with another by assigning each process its own virtual address space. The OS uses the Memory Management Unit (MMU) and access control to prevent unauthorized access. This isolation maintains stability and security in multitasking environments.
